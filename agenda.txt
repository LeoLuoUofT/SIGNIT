1. Show the code in action: folder of pictures, a video, then a streaming

2. explain what it does in pipeline_ex

3. Go into the classifier first (why accuracy is low). Explain whats going on and why you're not using pyspark machine learning
    a. transition into talking about SIGNIT_convert 

4. Go into SIGNIT_convert, dataset creation first, then explain whats going on.

5. Go into SIGNIT_stream, do an example stream from Twitch, explain how multiple streams are capable on stream_input.py. 
    a. Explain why you didn't use spark for stream input (cause its not supported)
    a2. explain the failed attempts
    b. explain how the pipelines are slightly different for streaming (i.e. edit greyscale image first then save as parquet)
    c. SIGNIT_stream does streaming
    d. explain intermediate results

6. explain how the main.py is made, how its a temporary, how it needed to be multi threaded and what happens if you stop it early.

7. DONE



agenda:
acquiring training data - seems easy, is not

streaming - need to resize everything first, spark streaming does not support images nor does it support fked up text files.

capable of doing multiple streams but need to run manually
